        <h1>Virat Kohli and the Power Of One8</h1>
        <small>By Rajiv Singh</small>
        <p>
          "Being aggressive is not a problem at all. If it drives you, it’s a
          great thing.” Virat Kohli, India captain
        </p>

        <p>
          Early August, 2018. It’s the second day of the first Test match
          between India and England at Edgbaston. The conditions are overcast,
          with the swinging cherry making the Indian batsmen sitting ducks for
          the slip cordon. Two wickets fall cheaply in a little over a dozen
          overs. The prospects for India in the inaugural Test of the keenly
          followed five-match series appear bleak.

          Enter skipper Virat Kohli, who is welcomed to the crease by hooting
          home spectators firmly behind their team. Standing far down the 22
          yards is a belligerent and purposeful James Anderson, who had
          dismissed Kohli four times during India’s last tour of England four
          years ago. Ten innings with scores of 1, 8, 25, 0, 39, 28, 0, 7, 6 and
          20, and an average of just 13.50 in 2014 are fresh in most minds at
          Edgbaston. Kohli finds himself hemmed in by a bunch of chatty close-in
          fielders. The setting looks ominous. By the end of day’s play,
          however, it was anything but that. Kohli played a gritty captain’s
          knock of 149, setting the tone for the series; he finished the five
          Tests with 593 runs at an impressive average of 59.3, emerging the
          highest run scorer in the series.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then, there’s been no stopping Kohli, who last fortnight became
          India’s most successful Test skipper after the 2-0 sweep against the
          West Indies in the Caribbean. His winning record of 58 percent takes
          him past accomplished leaders MS Dhoni (45 percent) and Sourav Ganguly
          (43 percent).
